### Kafka Latex Style

## Lecture Notes Template

This is my own latex style for lecture notes. Inspired from tufte style.
The source code in kafka_notes folder.
Features: 
- title,author,abstract,and tableofcontents in one page
- document page have margin notes

## Academic Resume Template
This is modified latex style for resume from overleaf "Software Engineer Resume". So I made academic version, with some addition.
Features: 
- Just fill the block, no more formatting

## Upcoming templates

There are some ideas pop in my mind to make my own style for
- Homework/Exams
- Presentation

I don't know when to works for those style, just wait.
